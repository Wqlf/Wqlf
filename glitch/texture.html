    <p style="text-align: center; color: #ffff72">Distortion, specifically in this class, has been interesting 
        to play around with. Perhaps, my favorite bit we've experienced thus far was in the 
        pixelated module. Finding smaller compositions within a larger image with the added
        challenge of making them look like <i>something</i> was truly enjoyable. Playing
        around with distortion in this way was fun and engaging. This isn't the only way we've
        used distortion in our modules.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align:center; color: green"><u>Distortion Reflection II</u></h2>
    <p style="text-align: center; color: forestgreen">Distortion, as I've learned, isn't only in making an image "poor
        quality." It can also be used to change an image as a whole. In module three,
        "Photoshop Masking and Compositing," we used perfect masks to distort original
        images based on the artist John Baldessari. This involved drawing on top of older
        images with bright colors and blocking out the silhouettes of figures and or backgrounds.</p>

        overwhelming, but as I've continued to work through it I've realized it was worse than I originally
        thought. However, I am not one to be a quitter (<i>usually</i>) and have decided to tackle this head
        on. The resources provided have actually been a great help in breaking everything down once I've 
        rewatched them. Of course, further delving into some specifics was needed, but we got there.
